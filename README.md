* First, thank you for setuping your website on your computer !

* Secondly, install ``composer``. Well, for installation, it will depend on your OS, so...

## How to install on a Windows OS

1. First, install composer from here : <https://getcomposer.org/>
2. Follow the `Getting Started` part. I'am lazy to explain you how to install it.
3. Run the following command on the root of our project : ```php composer.phar install```
4. This beautiful machina that is composer will do all the work for you.

## How to install it on a Linux OS

1. First, go to `terminal`
2. Then, run ``sudo apt install composer``
3. Wait 'till it's finished.
4. Then, as Windows, go to the project root, and do ```composer install```
5. YAY ! IT WORKS

## How to install it on a MacOS

1. Well well well. Like on Linux, open a `terminal`
2. Then, install brew. You'll need it on your life on MacOS. You'll find it here : <https://brew.sh/>
3. After that, go install composer. Here's a tutorial. Lazy to explain once more : <https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/309490/how-to-install-composer-via-homebrew>
4. Then, after installing composer, run this : ```composer install```.
5. That's it :smiley:

## Setup the database

* To make our website working, you'll need to install the database on ```PHPMyAdmin```
* You'll find it on the ``assets`` directory named as ```Twttr.sql```
* Then, after importing database, go to the ``config`` directory, and edit the file ```parameters.yml``` to setup your database credentials and making all these beauty to work
* Aaaaand that's it !
